# Pig Dice Game
Web based dice game made in JavaScript.

## Background
As I try to grow professionally, I am always trying to learn new things. This was part of the class I was taking at the time. 
I wanted to add a little more polish. So I changed a few things listed below.

## How To
You can just download the repo and open the Index.html in your browser to play.

## What I changed
* Functionality to turn off buttons that shouldn't be used instead of ignoring the click.
* Rules section at the bottom.
* As soon as the player rolls the dice the first time I disable the target score input field to avoid changing.

## What I learned / am Learning
* Basic JavaScript (variables, objects, functions, events...)
* Some CSS
* Some HTML
* Dom manipulation with JavaScript
