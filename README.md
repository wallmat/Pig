# Pig Dice Game
Web based dice game made in javascript.

## Background
This was created as part of a class for JavaScript with some slight changes that I wanted to add.

## How To
You can just download the repo and open the Index.html in your browser to play.

## Backgound
As I try to grow professionally, I am always trying to learn new things. This was part of the class I was taking at the time. 
I wanted to add a little more.

## What I changed
* Functionality to turn off buttons that shouldnt be used instead of ignoring the click.
* Rules section at the bottom.
* As soon as the player rolls the dice the first time I disable the target score input field to avoid chagning.

## What I learned / am Learning
* Basic JavaScript (variables, objects, functions, events...)
* Some CSS
* Some HTML
* Dom manipulation with JavaScript
